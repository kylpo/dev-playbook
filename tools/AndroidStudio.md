# Android Studio

## Tips
[Android Studio for Experts \(Android Dev Summit 2015\) \- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2GC6P5hPeA)

Do you use a command sometimes, but not enough to assign and memorize a hotkey?
- Use an abbreviation to find it faster in Command Search

## Hotkeys/commands

## Settings
- Use `Emacs Tab` as your `tab` to always adjust indentation to the correct spot regardless of where your cursor is on the line.
- Set `Toggle Sticky Selection` to something like `shift space` for easier selection (no need to hold `space`). It is similar to Emacs' `set-mark` and Vim's `Visual` mode.

## Plugins
#### [Key promoter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4455-key-promoter)
Shows to user how easy he can make same action using only keyboard

#### [konifar/android\-material\-design\-icon\-generator\-plugin](https://github.com/konifar/android-material-design-icon-generator-plugin)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konifar/android-material-design-icon-generator-plugin/master/docs/capture.gif)

#### [pbreault/adb\-idea](https://github.com/pbreault/adb-idea)
ADB commands in the Quick Operations popup. I particularly like the `ADB Clear App Data`

#### [Git Flow Integration](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7315-git-flow-integration)
![](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/files/7315/screenshot_16108.png)

#### [Databinding Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9271-databinding-support)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shiraji/databinding-support/master/websites/images/wrap.gif)

#### [Emacs\+ Patched](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10045-emacs-patched)
For the `tri-state center` and `HighlightNextSymbol` alone

#### [emacsIDEAs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7163-emacsideas)
Only for the better AceJump (more performant) than the dedicated [AceJump](https://github.com/acejump/AceJump) plugin

#### [Save Actions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)
For formatting, organizing imports, and arranging method order on save. This really should be built in to the ide.

#### [Tab Shifter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7475-tab-shifter)
Another one that should be part of the ide. This allows you to jump to the split on your right, bottom, left, and top, giving you more control than just going to the "next" or "previous".

#### [String Manipulation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162-string-manipulation)
![](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/files/2162/screenshot_15076.png)
For a handy way of changing naming style, aligning, and sort. I really appreciate that it comes with a popup menu, so I only need to remember one hotkey.
