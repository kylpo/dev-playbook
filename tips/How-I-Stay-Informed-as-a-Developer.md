# How I Stay Informed as a Developer
With software development constantly in flux, it has taken quite an effort to dial in my system for staying informed. "The right tool for the right job" is the name of the game.

## Digests
I am a huge fan of digests/newsletters! There's just SO much information published every week/day/hour, and I am grateful that others are willing to dig through it all and publish what they think are the best parts. Some digests are sent daily, but I prefer the weekly ones.

Also, I use [Google Inbox](https://inbox.google.com/)'s `Bundle` feature to collect all of these digests, and hide them until a designated time the next day. I do wish the time of day was configurable, but 7am will do for now...

## Twitter
I use Twitter for one thing: following developers. It is a great platform for following public discussions and seeing links/retweets of useful resources.

#### Using the timeline
I don't want to miss any tweets, so I have [Tweetmarker](http://tweetmarker.net/) save my position in the timeline. When I open [Tweetbot for Mac](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) or [Flamingo for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.twitter&hl=en), I am able to pick up from where I left off, not just from the top of the timeline. FOMO, no mo’!

When I do have time to check Twitter, I skim it. If a tweet looks like something worth digging in to, I `Like` it and keep moving. At the end of the day, following the "Inbox Zero" approach, I try to read through all of these Likes, un-Liking them as I go. It doesn't matter what Twitter rebrands the feature to, I'll always use it as a read-it-later system.

#### Focus
Developers are people, with non-developery things they'd like to talk about. This is a great use of Twitter, but does not fit with how I want to utilize it. Fortunately, Tweetbot's `Mute Filters` has my back! It hides all tweets with words like "Trump", "Hilary", "election", "religion", etc in them.

Sometimes, despite a person having great thoughts and tweets, they're just too chatty for me to handle in my system. So, I just `Unfollow` and rely on others to retweet the highlights.

## Github
I use the hell out of Github's `Subscribe` feature for Issues and Pull Requests, which sends me an email when someone responds in a thread. It helps me get a gauge for when a feature will land, and how it is being considered.

When I have a pain point with a project, I search its repo for an active Issue/PR and `Subscribe`. I also periodically check repos of projects I rely on to see if there are new, good threads to subscribe to.

Sometimes, when I really care about the activity of a repo, I temporarily `Watch` it. In doing so, I am auto-subscribed to all Issue/PR activity.

## Blogs
Back in the Google Reader days, I was an avid RSS user, slurping in 100+ posts/day. I treated it the way I treat Twitter today: as a reading list.

I suppose I still use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) as a reading list, but I follow significantly fewer blogs. I'd love to just be able to reduce this service into a single, weekly digest.

## Podcasts
I use [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) because it is cross platform (including browser), syncs progress, and has a speed-up option. For speakers without strong accents, I enjoy listening at 1.5x speed.

When I get in the car to drive to work, I turn on my [bluetooth receiver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MJMV0GU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Turning it on auto-launches Android Auto on my phone, which has Pocket Casts positioned prominently at the top. Pocket Casts is configured to play through all downloaded podcasts, so I just press Play, and I'm on my way.

## Youtube
Occasionally, I take a "Youtube Lunch": instead of going out, I watch something while I eat.

Youtube's `Watch Later` list is really great for this. I am able to avoid any analysis paralysis on Youtube's landing page by just going straight to a list of videos I've already deemed worth watching. When I'm there, I let my energy level decide what to play. If I'm feeling productive and motivated, I watch a technical video (conference or meetup talk). If I'm feeling drained, I watch an entertaining, educational video (science or history), or I watch something inspirational (usually a TED talk).

If I can clearly understand the speaker, I again enjoy watching at 1.25-1.5x speed. This speedup feature is amazing! I even sometimes avoid watching live content for the speedup option later.

## Wrapping it up
I'm happy with this system. It isn't easy by any means--I spend at least an hour a day consuming content--but it has kept me sane, and well informed.

Do you have a system? I’d love to hear about it!
