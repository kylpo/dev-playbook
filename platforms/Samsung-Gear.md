# Why care?
Because it is more capable than Android Wear and it seems like more Gear devices are sold than Wear. More and more tech companies have pulled away from Wear.

Samsung helped popularize Android to the masses. They're doing the same to Tizen with their watches.

[Quinn Nelson on Twitter: "I have never owned a Tizen\-based smartwatch but they look enticing because Android Wear is basically abandonware lol https://t\.co/3g7MwaKggo"](https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/902926031681536001)

# Devices
## Gear Fit 2
Only extension point for dev is replacing the watch face. See [this](https://developer.tizen.org/ko/forums/general-support/gear-fit-2-app?langswitch=ko) forum question for more. Also, it must be a Tizen Native app (TPK), not a web app (WGT).
