# Windows
## Where should it live?

#### Taskbar
Capabilities:

Considerations:

<!-- #### Dock
- Not just for launching. Can also show information.
- Just update the icon with information. See the built-in Activity Monitor, for example:
- ![](https://github.com/kylpo/dev-playbook/blob/master/assets/activity-monitor-icon.png?raw=true)
- Can also launch popups, like those shown in menubar. -->

#### Window
Considerations:

#### Floating window
- Above all others
- Often no titlebar
- Examples
    - ...
- Means you can essentially take over regions of the screen
    - ...

Considerations:

- adjustable opacity?
- adjustable style (to match user's background)?
- able to toggle "always on top"?
- resizable?
- global hotkeys?

#### Pinned to desktop (Desktop Widget)
- Pinned
- No titlebar
- Power users would have "easy" access to these via the `win d` hotkey to `Show Desktop`

Considerations:

- adjustable opacity?
- adjustable style (to match user's background)?
- able to toggle "always on top"?
- resizable?
- global hotkeys?


#### Misc
