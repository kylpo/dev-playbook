## Desktop Environments
[EXPLAINED : DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS OF LINUX \[KDE/GNOME/XFCE/LXDE\] \- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmgwHAXgB4&feature=youtu.be)

**The GUI part of an OS**. Contains everything you see on screen.
- Icons
- windows manager
- widgets
- functionality like drag + drop

Linux's equivalent to Windows Aero and Mac OS X Aqua, but unlike these two, the DE can be changed.

### KDE (Plasma)
QT framework, lots of complex features

Nicely customizable shortcuts: https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/customize-keyboard-shortcuts-on-kde-plasma-5/

Default apps: Woah, Dolphin is so customizable! https://youtu.be/pxXYXW4hvns

History of KDE https://youtu.be/VFwVg19-1sc
- panel and desktop widget system combined in 4.0, called Plasma, using plasmoids (widgets)
- 5.0 divided its core components into Plasma (desktop), KDE Applications, Development Tools (for apps built for KDE)

Plasma widgets, layouts, and desktop configuration: https://youtu.be/Tcfi6fivGys
- "Plasma is built on widgets. Everything you see from a application menu, to a notification icon, to a panel, is a widget"
- Widgets may be added to Desktop or on a panel
- All widgets will use the theme you've chosen

### Gnome 3
GTK+ toolkit, simplification, finer details to essentials

### Gnome 2

### XFCE
GTK+ toolkit, built for speed, minimal looks

### LXDE
GTK+ Toolkit, lighter than xfce

### Others
- Unity (Ubuntu's attempt, now discontinued)
- MATE (fork of gnome 2)
- Cinnamon (fork of gnome 3)
- Pantheon (GTK+ in Vala, used by Elementary OS)
- Deepin
- Budgie (switching from GTK+ to QT)

## DE vs Window Manager
As far as I know, DE contains the Window Manager.

Window Managers: X11, Wayland

## Distros
### Manjaro
[Why Is Manjaro So Popular? \- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGHTAYMX8T8&feature=youtu.be)
- Based on Arch, but is not Arch. More nooby-friendly. Means it inherits a superior packaging system.
- A rolling distro with well-tested updates (so near cutting-edge), multiple desktop environments, AUR (Arch User Repo), fantastic hardware support (mhwd) including Nvidia Optimus!  Again with Optimus, this is also the easiest distro to install and configure:  Literally NO manual installing at all...
This is also a good middle-ground between fixed and rolling release.

## GTK vs QT
Both are GUI toolkits + frameworks

GTK
- C
- Seems like GTK+ uses css for styles/themes

QT
- pronounced "cute"
- C++
- Free and proprietary licences (reason for controversy)
