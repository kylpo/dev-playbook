# Terminal and bash
![](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus/raw/master/docs/linux.png)

[Terminus](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/) (shown above) and [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) are feature-packed and look amazing, BUT they have a noticable delay when typing and scrolling in an editor like vim. Thankfully, Bash on Ubuntu on Windows does not have any of these perf issues.

Bash on Ubuntu on Windows uses the new WSL (Windows Linux Subsystem) to get an almost first-class bash on Windows.

Note that `~`, or `/home/<username>`, is your home for the subsystem. If you want to go to your Windows file home (typically on the `C:\` drive), go to `/mnt/c/Users/<username>`. This did confuse me at first. See [this](https://superuser.com/questions/1185033/what-is-the-home-directory-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/1185042) for more.

  - or the easier to configure [fujieda/xkeymacs](https://github.com/fujieda/xkeymacs) (be sure to use the snapshot version). Problem with this one is that it doesn't affect some system level inputs, like the `win` key search or `Explorer` address bar.
- Spaces
  - Virtual Desktops exist in Windows 10 now!
  - But, for whatever reason, there isn't a keybind to jump directly to a Space (`ctrl 1` by default to jump to Space 1, `ctrl 5` to jump to Space 5)
  - Use [win\-10\-virtual\-desktop\-enhancer](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer/blob/master/docs/settings.md#keyboard-shortcuts) to get the jump hotkeys. Also a nice little display to tell you what Space you jumped to.
- Hot Corners
  - [WinXCorners â€” Hot Corners for Windows 10](http://apps.codigobit.info/2015/10/winxcorners-hot-corners-for-windows-10.html)
  - I like my bottom-left corner to lock screens, so I use the custom action to `rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation` and set to bottom-left.
    - Found that command from [Command\-line \(cmd\) command to lock a windows machine \- Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/21179/command-line-cmd-command-to-lock-a-windows-machine)
