- OS-level emacs keybinds (like MacOS)
  - [usi3/emacs.ahk: An autohotkey script that allows you to use emacs-like key bindings on Windows environment](https://github.com/usi3/emacs.ahk)
  - or the easier to configure [fujieda/xkeymacs](https://github.com/fujieda/xkeymacs) (be sure to use the snapshot version). Problem with this one is that it doesn't affect some system level inputs, like the `win` key search or `Explorer` address bar.
- Spaces
  - Virtual Desktops exist in Windows 10 now!
  - But, for whatever reason, there isn't a keybind to jump directly to a Space (`ctrl 1` by default to jump to Space 1, `ctrl 5` to jump to Space 5)
  - Use [win\-10\-virtual\-desktop\-enhancer](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer/blob/master/docs/settings.md#keyboard-shortcuts) to get the jump hotkeys. Also a nice little display to tell you what Space you jumped to.
- Hot Corners
  - [WinXCorners â€” Hot Corners for Windows 10](http://apps.codigobit.info/2015/10/winxcorners-hot-corners-for-windows-10.html)
  - I like my bottom-left corner to lock screens, so I use the custom action to `rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation` and set to bottom-left.
    - Found that command from [Command\-line \(cmd\) command to lock a windows machine \- Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/21179/command-line-cmd-command-to-lock-a-windows-machine)

# Window Management
- use [WinDivvy](http://mizage.com/windivvy/) to move/position windows with your keyboard. Closest Windows app I could find to [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/).

- Remap keys with [sharpkeys: SharpKeys is a utility that manages a Registry key that allows Windows to remap one key to any other key\.](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys)
  - I use it to replace:
    - `caps_lock` -> `win`
    - `left_alt` -> `left_ctrl`
    - `left_win` -> `right_alt`
- Focus of active window
