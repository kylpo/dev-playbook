# Terms
### *transpile* vs *compile*
`compiler = (code) => executable`

`transpiler = (code) => code of other language`

### Guide vs Cookbook
> In the guide, we’re essentially telling a story. Each section builds on and assumes knowledge from each previous section. In the cookbook, each recipe can and should stand on its own. This means recipes can focus on one specific aspect of Vue, rather than having to give a general overview.
